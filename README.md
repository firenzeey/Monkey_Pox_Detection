# Monkey_Pox_Detection

This is a university project that I did for my Thesis in my Bachelor's degree.
The purpose of this project is to detect monkeypox after analyzing an image that is suspected of monkeypox.
Images can be uploaded and the model will predict whether it is monkeypox or not.
I took 3 Machine Learning models in this project - VGG-16, Resnet50, and Mobilenetv2. I trained the monkeypox dataset on all 3 models to see which one performed the best.
The VGG-16 model had the highest accurate results while mobilenetv2 took the least time for results.
